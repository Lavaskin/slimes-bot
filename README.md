# Slimes! Discord Bot


**How to build the bot**:

1. Fill out all the relevant information in a '.env' file. Use .env-example.txt as a reference.
2. Create an /other/firebase.json file from the json Firebase gives you on their site after you initialize a firestore database.
1. Run bot.py using python3 directly.
1. Note that I'm not going out of my way to support forks of the project so don't ask for help on setting it up.


**Bot Commands (Prefix: s!)**:

See [this description file](https://github.com/Lavaskin/slimes-bot/blob/main/other/desc.json) as I'm too lazy to maintain two lists, or use s!help on the bot.
